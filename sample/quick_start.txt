Quick Start Guide:

    Please see README.md for a full documentation.

1. Install external tools needed for conversion:

    1.1 JDK-8 must be used. JAVA_HOME must be set and 'java' must be in the PATH. 

    1.2 Get FFMPEG (https://ffmpeg.org/)

    1.3. Get x264 Encoder (http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html).
         10-bit version must be used!

    1.4. Get BMX: bmx2raw and raw2bmx applications from tools/bmx directory that contains proper BMX snapshots
    (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bmxlib/).

    1.5. Get ASDCP tool. Please build it from https://github.com/DSRCorporation/asdcplib-as02 repository.
         This is a fork from from http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/ which is enhanced to work properly with TTML wrapped in MXF.
         There is a Windows distribution there which can be used out of the box on Windows (TBD).

2. Download the source code of IMF Conversion Utility.

3. Build the source code (JDK-8 must be used!):
    ./gradlew clean build

4. Go to /build directory to find a distribution.

5. Extract the distribution and go to 'imf-conversion-utility-1.0.0' folder.

6. [Optional] Edit sample/config.xml if needed. It can be used as is, if all external tools installed at step 1 are added to the PATH.
   Please see README for a full description of config.xml.

7. Edit sample/metadata.xml if needed (either enter correct duration for PartDuration and TotalProgrammeDuration fields, or use 00:00:00:00).
   Please note that all timestamps are in SMPTE timecode format (hh:mm:ss:ff), where ff is in range [0,24] for 25 fps.
   Please see README for a full description of metadata.xml.
   A sample metadata.xml can be created by running the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -m metadata -o metadata.xml

8. [Optional] Edit sample/audiomap.xml if needed.
   Please see README for a full description of audiomap.xml.
   A sample audiomap.xml can be created by running the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -m audiomap -o audiomap.xml
     
9. Run conversion by executing the following command:

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -c sample/config.xml --metadata sample/metadata.xml -o outputName --imp path-to/imp --cpl CPL-name.xml -w path-to-output-folder

   if audiomap must be used, then run

        bin/imf-conversion-utility dpp -c sample/config.xml --metadata sample/metadata.xml --audiomap sample/audiomap.xml -o outputName --imp path-to/imp --cpl CPL-name.xml -w path-to-output-folder

   Please note, than -w, --imp and --cpl values can be set in config.xml instead.
    
10. An output flat files are created under the specified -w directory and called '{output-dir}/{outputName}.mxf' and '{output-dir}/{outputName}.stl'.

11. Logs:
    10.1 The current conversion job log file: /logs/imf-utility.log.
    10.2 Previous conversion jobs log files: /logs/archive.
    10.3 External tools log files: {output-dir}/logs.
